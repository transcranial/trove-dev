## Notes

Installation instructions:
    1.) unzip <Trove.src.zip> into desired folder
    2.) Modify <portNum> of trove-dev/server/config/environment/index.js -- port: process.env.PORT || <portNum> to desired serving port.
    3.) Start up a mongod (MongoDB) instance
    4.) To deploy, type in the command `npm start`

Recommended Usage:
    Deploy TROVE in two instances.
        Instance 1 will be the main listener for HL7 JSON messages.
        Instance 2 will be the main web server.
        See step 2.) for assigning different ports to the two instances

Database Information (MongoDB):
    When `npm start` is called from 4.) of Installation instructions, it will create a database instance, 'trove-dev'. In trove dev, there are two main collections to be associated with:
        - Studies (db.studies)
        - Users (db.users)

    Users must be of the form:
    { 
        "alt_name" : "Zoe Miller",
        "badges" : [],
        "full_name" : "Zoe Anne Miller",
        "minnies" : 1766,
        "userId" : "118",
        "username" : "zam7001"
    }

    The full_name is used with assistant_radiologist and radiologist to associate the order with a "userId". The username is used with passportjs to do authentication. 

    *IMPORTANT* users must be created manually/or from script previously before any data can be stored from the HL7 JSON listener route


Authentication + User Creation:
    Please see:
        http://danialk.github.io/blog/2013/02/23/authentication-using-passportjs/ & https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-local/blob/master/examples/express3-mongoose/app.js
    for information associated with authentication. The current distribution will require a developer to modify the code for authentication to work properly.

Server HL7 JSON processing Information:
    The main route for processing HL7 information is located in trove-dev/server/api/study/study.controller.js
        /processHL7JSON
        this method expects JSON messages of the form:
            {
                'accession':<String>,
                // Assistant Radiologist names should be of form 'Doe, John'
                // If this field is not filled, the server will try to parse a name from the 'report'. The name is found by matching the string pattern : var regex = /.*Prepared\sBy:(.*?)\|/; 
                'assistant_radiologist':<String>,
                // Radiologist names should be of form 'Doe, John'
                // If this field is not filled, the server will try to parse a name from the 'report'. The name is found by matching the string pattern: var regex = /.*Study\sinterpreted\sand\sreport\sapproved\sby:(.*?)\|/;
                'radiologist':<String>,
                'report':<String>,
                'service_code':<String>,
                'service_description':<String>,
                'result_time':<String>,
                // Result status general is a single character of form: 'P', 'F', ...
                // First 'P' status report is the report filed by Assistant Radiologist/Resident. Any 'P' status message recieved afterwards will be treated as a possibly edited report by the attending radiologist
                // 'F' status means the report has been finalized.
                'result_status':<String>,
                'scheduled_time':<String>, of form i.e. '201501010808'
                    '/d/d/d/d' year '/d/d' month '/d/d' date '/d/d' hour '/d/d' minutes  '/d/d' seconds. In that order.
                'transcribed_time':<String>, of form i.e. '201501010808'
                'completed_time':<String> of form i.e. '201501010808'
            }
